/**
 * @file coal_casthullshape.h
 * @brief CastHullShape: a lightweight wrapper for continuous collision detection.
 *
 * Analogous to Bullet's btCastHullShape, this wraps an underlying coal::ShapeBase
 * and a cast transform representing the relative motion from pose t=0 to t=1.
 * The narrowphase uses the Schulman support function which defers to the underlying
 * shape's exact support, so no convex hull or vertex tessellation is needed.
